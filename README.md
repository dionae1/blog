## About the Project

This is a modern, responsive, and performant web application built to serve as my digital business card. The design is minimalist, focused on content and user experience, using a dark color palette (Dark Mode) for visual comfort.


## Technologies Used

- **[React](https://react.dev/):** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** JavaScript superset that adds static typing.
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):** Fast build tool for modern web development.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling.
- **[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/):** Library for routing and navigation in the application.
- **[Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) & [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/):** Icon libraries.
